# Building guide

## Prerequisites:
- libcurl (most likely `libcurl` in your distro's repository).
- Any C compiler as long as it's compatible with C89 or later.

## Instructions:
- Run the `build.sh` script, it will produce a file named "uploader".
If you want, you can copy it to somewhere in $PATH and run it by just typing `uploader` in a shell.

# ratted-systems-uploader: C Edition
This is a rewrite of ratted-systems-uploader that took me some time (and external resources) to figure out

## How to use:
0. Build ratted-systems-uploader ([Build instructions](./BUILD.md))
1. Replace the contents of `example.token` with your Ratted Systems upload key.
2. To use the software, run `./uploader [file path]`.

## Notes:
- I can't be bothered to clean up the output right now.
- You need to build the software yourself.
- Any platform other than aarch64-unknown-linux-android24 is untested. If you want to build on a platform other than that, good luck.
